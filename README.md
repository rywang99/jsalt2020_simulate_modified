This repository contains modifications by the USTC-NERCSLIP team to the jsalt2020-simulation toolkit for CHiME-7 & CHiME-8. Its purpose is to generate meeting recordings with a higher overlap ratio, so it is not a plug-and-play repo. The main script logic lives in scripts/run_meetings_revb_chime8_MTG_t1_t2_wpe_gb.sh, where weâ€™ve adjusted the mixing code and replaced the configuration files.

This is the first update to the repository; we will enrich the details in future updates.
